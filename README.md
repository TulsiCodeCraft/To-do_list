# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# To-Do List Application

This project is a feature-rich To-Do List application built using ReactJS and Redux. It provides a responsive and user-friendly interface for managing tasks efficiently.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks with a simple input field.
- **View Tasks**: Displays all tasks in a structured list.
- **Delete Task**: Each task includes a delete button to remove it from the list.
- **Task Prioritization**: Allows setting task priorities (High, Medium, Low) and displays tasks accordingly.
- **Persistent Storage**: Utilizes local storage to save tasks, ensuring data persists across sessions.
- **User Authentication**: Includes a basic authentication system to protect tasks behind login/logout functionality.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
